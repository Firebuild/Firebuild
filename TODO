FireBuild TODO items
====================
- track changes to shared library search path
  Now processes report all the loaded shared libraries at start and exit.
  One idea is if /etc/ld.so.cache lists all libs used by the build at the
  same place where they were resolved in a cached run, the search path
  changes do not affect the build and cached results can be reused.
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH still has to be checked this case.
- add man page including detailed documentation for --insert-trace-markers
  usage
- export process tree to a self contained html file including style sheets and
  D3.js
